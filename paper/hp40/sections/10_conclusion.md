## 9. Conclusion

HP40 is a very good compressor that was never meant to be a general-purpose one.
Tuned only on Wikipedia, it still compresses an unrelated 27 MB mix 20%
smaller than xz -9e and brotli-11, and loses to them on only two of 41
distinct files. Its model is general: the mixer quietly ignores the text
experts on binary data, and the generic order-n, sparse, column, match and
self-discovering context experts do the work. Its *engineering* is not general:
at its tuned setting it commits 10.6 GiB and tens of seconds of start-up to
every file, runs at 8 KiB/s in both directions, and spends a third of its time
waiting on one random DRAM read per context model per bit.

Three findings carry over to any deployment:

1. **Use `--mem 16–18`, not 22.** Ratio drops 1.5–3.5%; memory drops 16–56×
   and start-up disappears.
2. **Use HP40-Lite.** With 43 of 75 experts it is 1.2% larger than HP40 and
   takes 44–52% less time with about 40% less memory. Lite at `--mem 22` is smaller
   *and* faster than HP40 at `--mem 18`, and Lite at 20 beats HP40 at 16.
3. **Fix the table layout before adding models.** Cache-line buckets,
   demand-zero allocation, input-sized tables, shared match history and a
   stored-block escape address every cost this study measured without
   touching the model.

The expert mining also gives the lab a ranking it lacked: the order-1…6
models and the discovery pool win 76% of all bits; the discovery pool is the
component that adapts HP40 to data nobody wrote a model for (it alone is worth
22% on a spreadsheet); and seven text families win under 1% of bits each on
general data.
